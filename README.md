**House Price Prediction - Bengaluru**


**Project Overview**


This project aims to predict house prices in Bangalore using the Kaggle dataset Bengaluru_House_Data. Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree were applied and compared. Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering were performed to improve the predictive power.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

**Models Used**

The following models were utilized and compared in terms of performance:

Linear Regression: A simple regression model that assumes a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.
Lasso Regression: An extension of linear regression that applies L1 regularization to prevent overfitting.
Decision Tree: A non-linear model that captures more complex relationships within the data.

**Results**

Linear Regression outperformed the other models, providing the most accurate predictions.
Lasso Regression performed similarly but added regularization to mitigate overfitting.
Decision Tree captured non-linear relationships but slightly underperformed compared to linear models.
Key insights from EDA and feature engineering significantly improved the prediction accuracy.
